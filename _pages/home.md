I am a Research Professional (predoc) in economics at the [Becker Friedman Institute for Economics](https://bfi.uchicago.edu), University of Chicago. I am working with Prof. [Oeindrila Dube](http://odube.net) on topics in development economics and political economy.  

I am interested in quasi-experimental research using large datasets to answer interesting socio-economic questions. I am broadly interested in development economics, labour economics and political economy. 

Previously, I worked as a senior data associate at [Good Business Lab (GBL)](https://www.goodbusinesslab.org) in New Delhi. I worked with [Prof. Achyuta Adhvaryu](https://www.achadhvaryu.com), [Prof. Anant Nyshadhyam](http://www.anantnyshadham.com) and [Prof. Teresa Molina](https://sites.google.com/site/teresasmolina/) on research in the topics of worker well-being. Prior to that I completed my masters in Economics from the [Paris School of Economics (PSE)](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/) in 2020 where I was a [Charapak Masters Scholar](https://www.inde.campusfrance.org/charpak-master-s-scholarship).
