I am an aspiring economist, curently working as a Senior Data Associate at Good Business Lab. 

I aim to use large datasets to answer interesting socio-economic questions. I am broadly interested in development economics, labour economics and political economy. 

Previously, I graduated with a masters in economics from the Paris School of Economics (PSE). I was awarded the Charapak Masters Scholarship from Campus France for pursuing my masters at PSE. Earlier, I graduated from University of Delhi with a B.A. (Hons) in Economics.
