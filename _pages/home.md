I am an incoming predoc at the Becker Friedman Institute for Economics, University of Chicago. I will be working with Prof. Oeindrila Dube on topics in development economics.  

I aim to use large datasets to answer interesting socio-economic questions. I am broadly interested in development economics, labour economics and political economy. 

Previously, I worked as a senior data associate at Good Business Lab (GBL) in New Delhi. Prior to that I completed my masters in economics from the Paris School of Economics (PSE) in 2020 as a Charapak Masters Scholar. Earlier, I graduated from University of Delhi with a B.A. (Hons) in Economics in 2018.
