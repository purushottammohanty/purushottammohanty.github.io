I am currently a PhD student in Economics at Duke University where I aim to work on quantitative research projects using large datasets on topics in development economics and political economy.  

Prior to joining Duke University, I was a Pre-doctoral Research Professional at the [Becker Friedman Institute for Economics](https://bfi.uchicago.edu), University of Chicago where I worked with [Prof. Oeindrila Dube](http://odube.net). Previously, I worked as a senior data associate at [Good Business Lab (GBL)](https://www.goodbusinesslab.org) in New Delhi. I completed my masters in Economics at the [Paris School of Economics (PSE)](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/) and my undergraduate studies in Economics at the [University of Delhi](https://du.ac.in).
