I am an aspiring economist, curently working as a Data Associate at Good Business Lab. 

I aim to use large datasets to answer interesting socio-economic questions. I am broadly interested in development economics and international trade. 

Previously, I graduated from University of Delhi with a B.A. (Hons) in Economics. Thereafter, I pursued my masters in Analysis and Policy in Economics (APE) at the Paris School of Economics.
