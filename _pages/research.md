### Exporter Re-Entry and Trade Liberalization
*Abstract*: Literature on exporter dynamics has been focussed on firm entry and exit decisions solely. Relatively little evidence exists on behaviour of firms with regards to re-entry to exporting markets. The dissertation provides insights into firm and market based factors influencing exporter re-entry using firm level data for Mexico. While many factors affect re-entry, results show existence of significant heterogeneity across firms with the top 5% firms being affected by industry specific factors more than firm specific factors while bottom 50% firms are more affected by firm specific factors. Furthermore, in a quasi-experimental framework I use the Mexico-Japan FTA to understand its effects on re-entry. FTA was found to have decreased re-entry by 1.3% largely on account of firms in the mineral industry. The findings highlight the need for significant further research into firm re-entry dynamics.

### Causal Effect of Mexico-Japan FTA on Mexican Exporters
*Abstract*: The paper estimates the effect of Mexico-Japan FTA on Mexican exporters while addressing concerns regarding exogeneity of previous studies. Using disaggregated panel data at the firm-product-destination level, and employing a difference-in-difference, the paper recovers causal effects of the FTA. The paper also provides analyses the heterogeneity of the effect across industries and firm sizes. Finally, it validates the results with robustness tests.
